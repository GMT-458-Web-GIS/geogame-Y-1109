            <h1>How to Play?</h1>
            <p>Welcome to <strong>INTERCOUNTRY</strong>! This is an exciting map-based game where your knowledge of countries and borders will be put to the test. Here’s how to play:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Start the game by clicking the <strong>"Start Game"</strong> button on the main screen.</li>
                <li>You’ll be given a map showing the globe, with a timer counting down from 120 seconds.</li>
                <li>On the right, you will see a list of three countries. Your task is to guess which country is located at the intersection of all three countries’ borders.</li>
                <li>Click on one of the three options that appear below the map to make your guess.</li>
                <li>If your guess is correct, you’ll earn 1 point, and the game will move on to the next round.</li>
                <li>If you guess incorrectly, you will lose the game, and your score will be displayed.</li>
                <li>The game lasts for 120 seconds. If you don’t answer all questions before time runs out, the game will end, and your score will be shown.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Your objective is to score as many points as possible within the 120 seconds. Good luck!</p>
            <p>Remember: You must choose the country that shares borders with all three countries shown. If you need help, refer to the map!</p>
            <p><strong>We wish you all a great game!</strong></p>
